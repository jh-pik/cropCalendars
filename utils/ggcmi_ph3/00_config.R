# Threshold-crossing noise filters (a matched pair). They attack the year-to-year
# sowing/harvest oscillation at its source: the per-DOY daily climatology
# (dtemp/dprec/dpet) carries ~1 degC / spiky day-to-day jitter, and the point
# detectors (calcDoyCrossThreshold: spring/fall temperature + wet-season-end
# crossings) otherwise latch onto a single-day blip -> a spurious crossing ~130 days
# off (e.g. a 1-day dip through temp_spring=14 in the autumn descent). The two knobs:
#   smooth_window      : the SINGLE global day-window the daily climatologies are read
#       through -- both the crossing detectors AND the window/extremum reductions
#       (warmest/coldest-month temperature, driest-month P/PET).
#       Set to 31 (~1 month, ODD) so the reductions stay monthly-equivalent AND the
#       crossings share the same smoothing (previously crossings used 15, reductions a
#       structural 30; unified here). ODD makes the centred smoothing/argmax exactly
#       symmetric -- an EVEN window centres half a day low (see .circRoll's caveat).
#       The 120-day wettest window (calcDoyWetMonth) keeps its own fixed window.
#   cross_min_duration : a crossing must stay on the new side of the threshold for
#       at least this many days to count (1 = off).

temp_cross_min_area <- c(2,8) # reproductive hot-day crossing (hd_temp_opt) degree-days budget, HYSTERETIC c(lo,hi),
                              # temperature analogue of cross_min_area. Damps hd_temp_opt EXISTENCE flicker where the
                              # warm plateau grazes temp_opt_rphase (subtropical/continental WW: Botswana, Mediterranean,
                              # Central Asia, N/NE China). 2/8 (strict hi=8 to flip INTO found; lenient lo=2 to stay) --
                              # genuinely-warm cells (area >> 8) unaffected. Rice's spring-crop down-crossing (large warm
                              # season) does not respond -- that residual was the floor tier, not topt. 0 = off.

# Wettest-window hysteresis (distance-weighted, max-normalised selection). For the
# ~57% of PREC/PRECTEMP cells with a near-tied second 120-day P/PET peak, the plain
# argmax flips between far-apart peaks year to year. The new rule picks
# argmax( (ws/max ws) * (1 - eps*dist_to_last_year/182.5) ): near peaks essentially
# free (tracks drift), far peaks must be decisively better to win. eps=0.5 cut the
# wet-cell mean year-to-year jump 1.59 -> 0.13 and cells-ever-flipping 0.257 -> 0.077.
wet_window_eps    <- 0.5      # wettest-window weight FLOOR = 1-eps (0 = plain argmax); far peak must be >1/(1-eps)x wetter to win
wet_window_decay  <- 0.3      # Gaussian decay scale of the distance weight (units of half-year; smaller = stickier)

# Seasonality-classifier hysteresis (threshold deadband). ~18% of cells flip their
# seasonality CLASS year to year (grazing the CV_prec/CV_temp/min_temp thresholds),
# which swaps the whole sowing rule. seas_eps relaxes the relative CV thresholds toward
# keeping last year's class (thermostat deadband); seas_mtemp_margin is the absolute
# deadband (deg C) on the min-temp threshold. seas_eps=0.25 cut class flips 18.3% -> 2.8%.
seas_eps          <- 0.25     # seasonality CV-threshold deadband (rel.; 0 = off)
seas_mtemp_margin <- 1        # seasonality min-temp threshold deadband (deg C)

# Harvest-rule hysteresis. Harvest dates flip more than sowing because several thresholds in
# the harvest rule are grazed by the sliding-window climatology. The wet-season decision is now a
# TWO-TIER rule organised by state at sowing (calcHarvestDateVector), with all its de-flickering
# built into the package and driven by two Schmitt mechanisms, NOT by the old deadbands:
#   * Wet-end ESCAPE wrap oscillating around sowing (the old dominant ~50% of flips): now self-healed
#     by the always-on WET-NEAR GATE (an end just before/after sowing both land on hd_first), window
#     WET_WINDOW_LO/HI (10/20).
#   * Wet-end EXISTENCE flicker (doy_wet1 FOUND <-> ABSENT): now damped by the cross_min_area Schmitt
#     c(lo,hi) above (a deficit-days budget hysteresis -- monotonic in dip depth, so unlike the old
#     level-threshold nudge it cannot erase the crossing it keeps). This SUPERSEDES harv_exist_eps
#     (the cc_regime path) as the default existence de-flicker.
#   * The old always-wet test (min_ppet vs ppet_min) and its harv_ppet_eps deadband are RETIRED: the
#     no-wet-end hd_last/hd_first decision is now the persistence-guarded two-tier rule (wet-near gate,
#     then the ppet_min floor tier with the same machinery). harv_ppet_eps is ignored.
#   * harv_tmax_margin (thermal-class deadband) gave ~0% historically (masked by moisture flicker).
#     With the moisture flicker removed (doy_wet2 retired, two-tier rule), the thermal-class boundary
#     is now a leading flicker source: warmest_t grazing temp_base/temp_opt flips the t-low/mid/high
#     class -> the whole harvest formula (hd_first<->hd_temp_base<->hd_temp_opt, ~16k cell-years). The
#     1 deg C deadband (mirroring seas_mtemp_margin) stabilises the class hysteretically; a replay
#     hotspot (Winter_Wheat 32.25/-19.75, warmest_t ~25 = temp_opt) drops 6->3 big jumps (the residual
#     is a separate within-rule crossing-date wobble). Enabled.
harv_ppet_eps     <- 0         # RETIRED/ignored (was always-wet test deadband)
harv_exist_eps    <- 0         # superseded by the cross_min_area Schmitt (cc_regime path off)
harv_tmax_margin  <- 1         # harvest-rule temp_max threshold deadband (deg C; 0 = off) -- thermal-class thermostat
wet_near_min_area <- c(2,5)    # wet-near gate INTEGRATED budget c(lo,hi) HYSTERETIC (0 = off): the gate fires when
                               # sum(daily_ppet[window]-ppet_ratio) over above-threshold days >= budget, instead of
                               # any-day-above (a single-day max that flips on the peak grazing the threshold). Reads a
                               # thin touch (area~0) as NOT wet -> latches the TIER1<->TIER2 selector. Big harvest win:
                               # NE-China Maize monsoon -84%, neutral on the broad population; complements (does NOT
                               # replace) the 20/40 window-WIDTH hysteresis (tested -- fixed window regresses the monsoon).
                               # Keyed on prev_wet_near (no extra state). 2/5 paired with the ppet_min floor Schmitt.

# Winter-regime sowing thermostat (winter-type / Winter_Wheat only). The winter regime is classified
# warm / mild / cold by two coldest_t thresholds -- the warm boundary (basetemp.low) and the cold
# boundary (-10 C) -- and each regime picks a different autumn-sowing anchor. When coldest_t grazes
# either boundary the sowing flips ~half a year between adjacent years (the dominant winter-wheat
# sowing-flicker mode; a replay cell at Quebec -72.25/45.25 toggles 264<->107 on a 0.2 deg C wobble at
# the -10 boundary). The 1 deg C deadband (mirroring seas_mtemp_margin / harv_tmax_margin) carries last
# year's regime and relaxes BOTH boundaries toward it (2*margin = 2 deg C sticky band each), latching
# the cell into one regime. Enabled.
winter_margin      <- 1        # WARM winter boundary (basetemp.low) deadband (deg C; 0 = off)
winter_cold_margin <- 2        # COLD winter boundary (-10 C) deadband (deg C; 0 = off); decoupled, set to 2 to fully latch the Russia continental autumn<->spring WW flip (measurement suggested ~2)

# Spring up-crossing depth gate REMOVED (was spring_offset/spring_margin). The temp_spring up-crossing is
# now always scanned forward from the centroid coldest_doy; when the trough never dips below temp_spring
# there is no crossing and the mean-anchored fallback (mean above temp_spring -> coldest_doy ~Jan; below
# -> warmest_doy) resolves the placeholder -- the same DOY a gated-off cell landed on, so the gate was a
# no-op once the fallback became mean-based. See calcSowingDate.R.
