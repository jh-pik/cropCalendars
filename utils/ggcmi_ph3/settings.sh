# Sourced by the *.sh job scripts (native bash) and parsed by 00_config.R for
# the R side. Use plain KEY=VALUE with no spaces around "=".
#
# Keys read by R (OUTPUT_DIR, CLIMATE_DIR, ISIMIP3B_PATH, AGMIP_DIR) must be
# LITERAL paths — the R parser does not expand shell variables. Bash-only keys
# further down (NCDF_DIR, PUBLISH_DIR) may reference earlier keys; they are only
# `source`d by bash, where the expansion happens.

# When moving this pipeline to a new location, edit THIS file only.

# Climate input roots, read-only. Colon-separated SEARCH LIST (no trailing slash):
# the annual driver discovers each <root>/<scenario>/<gcm>/*_<var>_global_daily_*.nc
# and uses the first root that has the files. Official ISIMIP roots only:
#   ISIMIP3b primary + secondary  -> the ESMs (all SSPs, historical, picontrol);
#   ISIMIP3a obsclim + spinclim   -> the observational forcings (GSWP3-W5E5 etc.):
#     scenarios are named directly "obsclim"/"spinclim" (files under "historical").
# The GGCMI land mask (ggcmi_landcells.csv, 67420 cells) is applied uniformly, so the
# full-grid official files are subset to the same cells (the ISIMIP no-ant mask is a
# subset of these, and GSWP3-W5E5 covers all 67420).
