#' @title Calculate sowing date (Waha et al., 2012)
#'
#' @param monthly_temp Numeric vector of length 12. Average (e.g. 20-years)
#' monthly mean temperatures (degree Celsius). Retained as a fallback: the
#' coldest-month temperature and the coldest-day anchor are taken from
#' \code{daily_temp} (coldest 30-day window) when supplied, and only derived from
#' these monthly values if \code{daily_temp} is \code{NULL}.
#' @param daily_prec Numeric vector of length 365. Climatological daily
#' precipitation (mm, one value per DOY, averaged across years). The
#' \code{dprec} element from \code{calcClimatology}. Used by
#' \code{calcDoyWetMonth} (with \code{daily_pet}) to find the start of the wet
#' season as the wettest 120-day window (\eqn{\sum P / \sum PET}). Preferred input
#' for the wettest-window start in PREC/PRECTEMP cells; if absent, the monthly
#' fallback (\code{monthly_prec} / \code{monthly_pet}) is used instead.
#' @param daily_pet Numeric vector of length 365. Climatological daily PET (mm,
#' one value per DOY). The \code{dpet} element from \code{calcClimatology}.
#' Paired with \code{daily_prec} (see there).
#' @param daily_temp Numeric vector of length 365. Climatological daily mean
#' temperature (°C), one value per DOY (the \code{dtemp} element from
#' \code{calcClimatology}). Used for the coldest-month reductions (coldest
#' 30-day window mean and centre DOY) and by \code{calcDoyCrossThreshold} for the
#' spring/fall threshold crossings. \code{NULL} falls back to the legacy monthly
#' rule (calendar-month minimum and coldest-month mid-day) and interpolates the
#' monthly means onto the daily grid for the crossings.
#' @param seasonality character value indicating the seasonality type as
#' computed by calcSeasonality
#' @param prev_wet_doy Integer DOY of last year's wettest-window start (or
#' \code{NA}), forwarded to \code{calcDoyWetMonth} for temporal hysteresis in the
#' PREC/PRECTEMP sowing branch. Only used when \code{wet_window_eps > 0}.
#' @param wet_window_eps Non-negative relative hysteresis band forwarded to
#' \code{calcDoyWetMonth} (default 0 = off). See \code{?calcDoyWetMonth}.
#' @param wet_window_decay Positive Gaussian decay scale forwarded to
#' \code{calcDoyWetMonth} (default 0.3; smaller = stickier). See
#' \code{?calcDoyWetMonth}.
#' @param cross_min_duration Integer minimum sustained-excursion length (days)
#' forwarded to \code{calcDoyCrossThreshold} for the spring/fall temperature
#' crossings (default 1 = off). See \code{?calcDoyCrossThreshold}.
#' @param smooth_window Integer day-window for the daily-climatology smoothing -- the
#' single global window applied to BOTH the threshold-crossing input (\code{daily_temp}
#' smoothed before the spring/fall crossings) AND the daily reductions here (coldest-window
#' mean and coldest/warmest anchor DOYs). Default 31 (odd). See \code{calcCropCalendars}. The raw
#' daily climatology is still kept; this only sets the window the rules read it through.
#' @param monthly_prec,monthly_pet Optional numeric vectors of length 12, the
#' monthly precipitation and PET TOTALS (the \code{mprec} / \code{mpet} elements
#' from \code{calcClimatology}). Used only as the bug-free monthly fallback for
#' the wettest-window start in PREC/PRECTEMP cells, when
#' \code{daily_prec}/\code{daily_pet} (and \code{wet_doy}) are not supplied: the
#' wettest 4-month ratio-of-sums (\eqn{\sum P / \sum PET}). Coarser (~1-month
#' resolution) than the daily 120-day rule, but identical in form (sums P and PET
#' separately, no daily interpolation).
#' @param wet_doy Optional pre-computed wettest-window start DOY (the crop-independent
#' \code{calcDoyWetMonth} result). When supplied it is used directly in the
#' PREC/PRECTEMP spring-sowing branch, so the caller (\code{calcCropCalendars}) can
#' compute it once per cell instead of twice. \code{NULL} (default) recomputes it.
#' @param prev_winter Integer winter regime chosen last year (1 = warm, 0 = mild, -1 = cold), or
#' \code{NA} (default). Used (when \code{winter_margin > 0} or \code{winter_cold_margin > 0}) to make the
#' winter-regime boundaries (\code{basetemp.low} and \eqn{-10}\,°C) hysteretic. Returned as
#' \code{attr(., "winter_regime")} for the caller to carry forward. Only winter-type
#' (\code{WTYP_CALC_SDATE}) crops act on it.
#' @param winter_margin Absolute deadband (deg C, default 0 = off) on the WARM winter-regime boundary
#' (\code{basetemp.low}, the warm<->mild / autumn-anchor split). With a prior regime it relaxes toward
#' last year's regime so the regime is sticky within a \code{2 * winter_margin} band, suppressing the
#' ~half-year warm<->mild sowing flip when \code{coldest_t} grazes the boundary. Mirrors
#' \code{seas_mtemp_margin} / \code{harv_tmax_margin}.
#' @param winter_cold_margin Absolute deadband (deg C, default 0 = off) on the COLD winter-regime boundary
#' (\eqn{-10}\,°C, the mild<->cold / autumn-sowing<->spring-fallback split). Decoupled from
#' \code{winter_margin} so the continental cold boundary (Russia autumn<->spring WW flip) can be widened
#' independently of the warm boundary. Same prior-regime relaxation (sticky within \code{2 * winter_cold_margin}).
