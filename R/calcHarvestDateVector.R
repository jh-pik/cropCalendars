#' @title Calculate vector of possible harvest dates (Minoli et al., 2019)
#'
#' @description Harvest reasons are the events that can trigger the harvest
#' of a crop within an agro-climatic zone:
#' Earliest-maturing cultivar (GPmin);
#' Cultivar with longest grain filling (GPmaxrp);
#' Latest-maturing cultivar (GPmax);
#' Escape terminal water stress (w. lim);
#' Grain filling in warmest period (mid. t.);
#' Escape high temperature (high t.).
#'
#' The temperature- and water-driven harvest dates (\code{hd_wetseas},
#' \code{hd_temp_base}, \code{hd_temp_opt}) are evaluated on the \emph{daily}
#' climatology, consistent with \code{calcSowingDate}. Evaluating them on the
#' 12 monthly values instead quantises these dates to whole months, which makes
#' the resulting harvest dates flip by ~30 days between climate windows (e.g.
#' when the warmest month alternates between July and August).
#'
#' @param croppar data.frame with crop parematers as returned by getCropParam
#' @param sowing_date numeric value as day of the year (DOY). This can be either
#' caculated with calcSowingDate or prescribed.
#' @param sowing_season character value. Can be either "winter" or "spring". See
#' calcSowingDate.
#' @param monthly_temp numeric vector of length 12. Mean monthly air temperature
#' (degree Celsius).
#' @param monthly_ppet numeric vestor of length 12. Mean Potential Evapotranspiration (mm). See calcClimatology.
#' @param monthly_ppet_diff DEPRECATED and ignored. Was the monthly P/PET trend feeding the
#' retired \code{doy_wet2} trend wet-end estimate (see NEWS). Kept in the signature so existing
#' \code{calcCropCalendars} calls do not break.
#' @param daily_temp numeric vector of length 365. Climatological daily mean
#' temperature (deg C), one value per DOY (the \code{dtemp} element from
#' \code{calcClimatology}). If \code{NULL}, it is interpolated from
#' \code{monthly_temp}.
#' @param daily_prec numeric vector of length 365. Climatological daily
#' precipitation (mm) per DOY (the \code{dprec} element from
#' \code{calcClimatology}). Used with \code{daily_pet} to form the spike-free
#' daily P/PET (ratio of per-DOY means) for the wet-season-end crossing. If
#' \code{NULL}, the daily P/PET is interpolated from \code{monthly_ppet} instead.
#' @param daily_pet numeric vector of length 365. Climatological daily PET (mm)
#' per DOY (the \code{dpet} element from \code{calcClimatology}).
#' @param cross_min_duration integer minimum sustained-excursion length (days)
#' forwarded to \code{calcDoyCrossThreshold} for the hot-day temperature crossings
#' (default 1 = off). The wet-season-end LEVEL crossing (\code{doy_wet1})
#' is guarded by \code{cross_min_area} alone (its \code{min_duration} is retired, since a
#' deficit-days budget >= ~2 already implies multi-day persistence). See \code{?calcDoyCrossThreshold}.
#' @param cross_min_area Integrated-excursion (deficit-days) budget for the wet-season-end LEVEL
#' crossing (\code{doy_wet1}, \code{daily_ppet} vs \code{ppet_ratio}; also the tier-2 \code{ppet_min}
#' floor crossing) -- magnitude-weights persistence so a grazing P/PET crossing must persist far
#' longer to count. A length-2 \code{c(lo, hi)} HYSTERETIC (Schmitt) pair: a previously-FOUND wet-end
#' (\code{prev_wetend_found}) uses the lenient \code{lo}, a previously-ABSENT one the strict \code{hi},
#' so a dip whose area grazes the budget does not flip the wet-end's existence year to year. A scalar
#' means \code{lo == hi} (no hysteresis); default 0 = off. See \code{?calcDoyCrossThreshold}.
#' @param smooth_window Integer day-window for the daily-climatology smoothing -- the single
#' global window applied to BOTH the crossing inputs (the hot-day \code{daily_temp} crossing,
#' and \code{daily_prec} / \code{daily_pet} before the wet-season-end P/PET ratio) AND the
#' reductions (\code{warmest_day}, driest-window P/PET).
#' Default 31 (odd). See \code{calcCropCalendars}.
#' @param prev_rw1 Integer level wet-end EXISTENCE regime from last year (0 = absent-DRY,
#' 1 = found, 2 = absent-WET), or \code{NA}. Used only on the \code{cc_regime} path when
#' \code{harv_exist_eps > 0}.
#' @param harv_exist_eps Non-negative relative directional deadband (default 0 = off) on the
#' wet-end EXISTENCE boundary (the \code{ppet_ratio} level crossing, \code{doy_wet1}). Leaving
#' the absent-DRY regime needs the peak to clear \code{ppet_ratio * (1 + eps)}; leaving
#' absent-WET needs the trough below \code{ppet_ratio * (1 - eps)}. Experimental, gated by
#' \code{options(cc_regime = TRUE)}.
#' @param prev_wet_near Logical hysteresis state from last year (or \code{NA}): was the cell wet
#' near sowing? Drives the always-on WET-NEAR GATE -- the wet-season escape (and the no-wet-end
#' \code{hd_last}/\code{hd_first} decision) is taken only when the cell is wet within a hysteretic
#' window after the (temperature-set) sowing; otherwise it falls to the aridity-floor tier and, if
#' that also fails, to \code{hd_first}. Previously-wet widens the window (\code{options(cc_wet_window_hi)},
#' default 20), previously-dry narrows it (\code{cc_wet_window_lo}, default 10). The resolved value is
#' carried forward packed into \code{attr(., "harv_hi")} (12x bit).
#' @param prev_wetend_found Logical hysteresis state from last year (or \code{NA}): did a wet-end
#' (\code{doy_wet1}) exist? Selects the Schmitt bound of \code{cross_min_area} (found -> lenient
#' \code{lo}, absent -> strict \code{hi}). The resolved value is carried forward in the
#' \code{attr(., "harv_hi")} 6x bit. \code{NA} on the first year uses the strict bound.
#' @param temp_cross_min_area Integrated-excursion (degree-days) budget for the reproductive-phase
#' hot-day temperature crossing (\code{hd_temp_opt}: \code{daily_temp} vs \code{temp_opt_rphase}) --
#' the temperature analogue of \code{cross_min_area}, magnitude-weighting the crossing so a smoothed
#' temperature that merely grazes \code{temp_opt_rphase} must persist far longer to register a hot
#' season. Damps the \code{hd_temp_opt} EXISTENCE flicker in marginal cells whose warm plateau sits at
#' the threshold (e.g. subtropical winter wheat). A length-2 \code{c(lo, hi)} HYSTERETIC pair like
#' \code{cross_min_area}: a previously-FOUND crossing (\code{prev_topt_found}) uses the lenient
#' \code{lo}, a previously-ABSENT one the strict \code{hi}. Scalar = no hysteresis; default 0 = off.
#' @param prev_topt_found Logical hysteresis state from last year (or \code{NA}): did the reproductive
#' hot-day crossing (\code{doy_opt_rp}) exist? Selects the Schmitt bound of \code{temp_cross_min_area}.
#' Carried forward in the \code{attr(., "harv_hi")} 24x bit. \code{NA} on the first year = strict.

# coldest day, max at the warmest). NOT the argmax: which.max is hypersensitive in cells
# with a broad, flat summer plateau (and degenerate where the plateau straddles the
# calendar-year boundary, e.g. subtropical Southern-Hemisphere cells, so the single
# warmest day jumps +-30..180 d between adjacent climatology years). That jitter feeds
# hd_temp_base (= warmest_day [+ rphase]) in the harvest rule and warmest_doy (the cold-cell
# spring-temperature fallback in calcSowingDate). The centroid averages over the whole warm
# plateau (~10x more stable) while staying a pure PHASE estimator -- weights depend on the
# SHAPE of the cycle, not its level, so it does not drift with warming. For a sharp summer
# peak it ~= argmax. Degenerate constant series (all weights 0) -> atan2(0,0)=0 -> DOY 1.
